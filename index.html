      <h3>New Vr Experience kills people</h3>
      <p>As you know we have dramatically advanced in technologies as of late.
         Creators are finding more ways to
         advance their technologies.
         With the release of the VR headset individuals have wondered
          could we take it further.
         They have come up with a prototype that allows the players mind to be taken into the game.
         With this being said the first volunteer that died within the
          game ended up dying in real time.
         They say his last cries were “Get it off, it’s to real!”
         Witnesses say he was playing a shooter game. The known cause
          of death was a stress induced heart-attack.
         Needless to say they will either have to ban there project
         altogether or make it less stress inducing.</p></div>

      <h3>Building flies into Airplane</h3>
      <p>In Trenton, New Jersey a recent event shocked the people.
         A 11 story apartment building with over 500 residents
          collided with a small personal plane.
         Witnesses say that the building was over two decades old.
          The structure was wearing thin.
         As support beams wayed on one another the building looked
          as if it was flying. This tragic event caused
          31 deaths including the pilot,
         60 server injuries, and 40 minor injuries.
         This incident is an eye opener for the public that old
          buildings should have a structure analysis done
          more often to prevent more incidents like this.</p></div>

               When a man runs out of firewood he goes to his local church to
                see if he can use the grill.
               No one was home so being under the influence the man proceeded
                to go ahead and have his way with there grill.
               The man quotes “I didn’t realize when I was carrin the gasoline
                out, that it was spilling everywhere.”
               So, as the story goes the man lit the grill and ended up with a
                church in flames.</div>

             <h3>Man tries to fly from Empire State Building</h3>
             <p>As strange as the title sounds this was a true event that happened
                early Saturday morning in New York city.
                Witnesses say they saw a man climbing to the roof of the Empire
                 State Building with a grand
                 set of ‘bird like wings’.
                As officials rushed to the seen they witnessed the man jump from
                 the building and start
                 flapping wildly in his attempt to fly.
                They say as the man flapped he called out “I am a bird.”
                 Of course thought the gravity took
                 the best of the man as he plummeted down,
                with no signs of ever flying.</p></div>

                    receives to much love he unfortunately passes.
                   As his viewers quote “A man donated him one million dollars,
                   Danny seemed so overjoyed that he started to stress out and when
                    he told us ‘I will be right back’ he turned and fell out of his chair.
                   We as his fans took action and called the paramedics, but by the
                   n it was too late.” The man's unfortunate death left his fans in
                    totally sadness. This is a lesson to all,
